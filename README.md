# Data Pagination and Filtering

> In this project, you'll use a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

> You'll start with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. You'll start by using your JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. Then you will add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.
